- added using CVS keywords in %changelog (for automating them).

* Mon May 31 1999 Arkadiusz Mi¶kiewicz <misiek@pld.org.pl>
- PLDized (spec rewrited)

* Mon Feb 22 1999 David Axmark <david@detron.se>
- Removed unportable cc switches from the spec file. The defaults can
  now be overridden with environment variables. This feature is used
  to compile the official RPM with optimal (but compiler version
  specific) switches.
- Removed the repetitive description parts for the sub rpms. Maybe add
  again if RPM gets a multiline macro capability.
- Added support for a pt_BR translation. Translation contributed by
  Jorge Godoy <jorge@bestway.com.br>.

* Wed Nov 4 1998 David Axmark <david@detron.se>
- A lot of changes in all the rpm and install scripts. This may even
  be a working RPM :-)

* Sun Aug 16 1998 David Axmark <david@detron.se>
- A developers changelog for MySQL is available in the source RPM. And
  there is a history of major user visible changed in the Reference
  Manual.  Only RPM specific changes will be documented here.
