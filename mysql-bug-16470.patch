  Bug #16470 crash on grant if old grant tables
  
  If a user upgraded the server without running mysql_upgrade, and later tried
  to run a GRANT command on grant tables like tables_priv, the server would
  crash.
  
  This patch fixes this problem by checking if the grant tables were properly
  initialized before attempt to store any new grants.

    If grant_reload fails, don't try to store new GRANTs because the grant tables
    weren't properly initialized.
