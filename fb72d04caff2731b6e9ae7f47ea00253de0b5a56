- 3.23.49, STBR
- Don't give warning for statement that is only a comment; This is needed for
  mysqldump --disable-keys to work.
- Fixed unlikely caching bug when doing a join without keys. In this case the
  last used field for a table always returned NULL.
- Added options to make LOAD DATA LOCAL INFILE more secure.
- MySQL binary release 3.23.48 for Linux contained a new glibc library,
  which has serious problems under high load and RedHat 7.2. The 3.23.49
  binary release doesn't have this problem.
